# *Dynamic web pages with JavaScript*.
### First  you need to know how JavaScript language will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages.
#### 1. JavaScript language care about behavior layer, You can create js file if end with this exetention(.js)
#### 2. HTML care about contant layer, You can create js file if end with this exetention(.HTML)
#### 3. CSS language care about presention layer, You can create js file if end with this exetention(.CSS)
The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability o the page or the experience of interacting with the site.Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript.
In js we have three types of date 
1. number (1,2,5.0)
2. starings("5" ,"h2o","gh")
3. boolean(true(1),false(0)
### some rules in js
to write html in js use ''' document .write( ' <h3>' +greeting + ' </ h3> '); '''
Variable is a way to programmatically reference a previously assigned value.
to write if statment first you should variables are already declared than this the strcture of if statment
if (hourNow > 18) {
greeting= 'Good evening!';
else if (hourNow > 12) {
greeting = ' Good afternoon!';
else if (hourNow > 0) {
greeting = 'Good morni ng!';
else {
greeting = 'Welcome! ' ;
To link js with html use <script> element,You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files)
### SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR
like any new language, there are new words to learn (the vocabulary) and rules for how these can be put together (the grammar and syntax of the language)
You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code you can use ''' // '''
